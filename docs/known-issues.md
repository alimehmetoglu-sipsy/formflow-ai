## ⚠️ High Priority Issues (P1)

### 1. Dashboard Generation Timeout for Complex Forms
**Issue ID:** BUG-2024-047  
**Reported:** December 15, 2024  
**Status:** 🔍 Under Investigation  
**Severity:** High  
**Frequency:** 3-5% of dashboard generations

**Description:**
Forms with >50 fields or very long text responses can cause dashboard generation to timeout after 5 minutes, resulting in a "Generation Failed" status.

**Impact:**
- Users with comprehensive surveys experience failures
- Particularly affects health coaches and detailed assessments
- Leads to user frustration and potential churn

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- OpenAI API calls take longer for large payloads (>4000 tokens)
- Template selection algorithm inefficient for complex data
- Database timeout on large JSON insertions

**Current Workaround:**
- Users can reduce form field count
- Break large forms into multiple smaller submissions
- Customer support can manually retry generation

**Fix Status:**
- **Phase 1:** Increase timeout to 8 minutes (✅ Completed)
- **Phase 2:** Implement progressive generation with status updates (🚧 In Progress - 60%)
- **Phase 3:** Optimize AI prompts for large datasets (📅 Planned - Feb 2025)

**Technical Details:**
```python
# Current timeout handling
async def generate_dashboard_with_timeout(form_data: dict, timeout: int = 480):
    try:
        dashboard = await asyncio.wait_for(
            generate_dashboard(form_data), 
            timeout=timeout
        )
        return dashboard
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await log_generation_failure(form_data, "timeout")
        raise DashboardGenerationTimeout("Generation took longer than expected")
```

**Root Cause:**
- Open Graph meta tags not properly rendered for dynamic content
- Image generation for social previews timing out
- Mobile browsers caching old preview data

**Workaround:**
- Users can copy direct links instead of using share buttons
- Desktop sharing works properly
- Manual refresh sometimes resolves preview issues

**Fix Progress:**
- **Meta tag optimization:** ✅ Completed
- **Preview image generation improvements:** 🚧 70% complete
- **Mobile-specific sharing optimizations:** 📅 Planned - Feb 2025
