# ✅ Google Forms Integration - READY TO TEST!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!
The application now accepts **multiple submissions** from the same Google Form. Each submission creates a new unique dashboard.

## 📝 How to Test:

### Option 1: Submit New Form Response
1. Open your Google Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWsfjdmzpg-YuqjIjc7rjZ3PvurkKV9Nu5Y7GBot_KY6gU_w/viewform
2. Submit the form with any data
3. Check Apps Script logs for success message
4. View new dashboard at http://localhost:3000/dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Test from Apps Script
1. Open Google Apps Script editor
2. Run the `testWebhook()` function
3. Check console for success response
4. Each run creates a **new** dashboard (no more "already_processed" errors!)

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:
- Added UUID to each submission's response_id
- Each form submission now gets a unique identifier like: `response_id_abc123de`
- Multiple submissions from the same form are now allowed
- Dashboard URLs are unique for each submission

## 📊 Test Results:
```json
// First submission
{
  "status": "success",
  "dashboard_url": "http://localhost:3000/dashboard/same_res_50f2d213",
  "submission_id": "b1a16c5e-bbb8-4c9d-8751-cdcf447f305e"
}

// Second submission (same form, different dashboard!)
{
  "status": "success",
  "dashboard_url": "http://localhost:3000/dashboard/same_res_eacb9a31",
  "submission_id": "a2b102f4-3ba5-43ff-8e9d-ae0b3aeef576"
}
```

## 🚀 Current Status:
- **Backend**: Running ✅
- **Webhook URL**: https://moody-actors-sin.loca.lt/api/v1/webhooks/google-forms
- **User ID**: 5316def1-a2a3-4622-9c78-920d88d907fe
- **Multiple Submissions**: ENABLED ✅

You can now submit your Google Form multiple times and each submission will create a new dashboard!
